Key Achievements:

•	Automated Cloud Resource Management:
o	Serverless Automation: Designed and implemented serverless solutions using AWS Lambda to manage Amazon RDS instances, resulting in a [percentage]% reduction in operational costs.
o	Intelligent Traffic Monitoring: Developed a Python-based Lambda function to monitor CloudWatch metrics and automatically stop RDS instances during low traffic periods, optimizing resource usage.
o	On-Demand Resource Activation: Created an API Gateway endpoint to trigger RDS instance start-up via a Lambda function, ensuring high availability and reducing downtime for critical applications.
o	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Leveraged Infrastructure as Code practices to manage and deploy cloud resources, improving deployment speed and reliability.
o	Technology Stack: AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS API Gateway, Python (Boto3)



Notable Results:

•	Cost Efficiency: Achieved [specific metric, e.g., 30%] cost savings by automating the start/stop of RDS instances based on traffic.
•	Operational Excellence: Enhanced system reliability and responsiveness through automated resource management and on-demand activation.
•	Reduced Manual Intervention: Decreased the need for manual monitoring and intervention, freeing up engineering resources for higher-value tasks.
